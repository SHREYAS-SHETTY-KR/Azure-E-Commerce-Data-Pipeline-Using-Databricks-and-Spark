# Azure-E-Commerce-Data-Pipeline-Using-Databricks-and-Spark

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline for processing E-Commerce data using Microsoft Azure services. The pipeline includes data ingestion, processing, storage, and visualization. The architecture leverages Azure Data Factory for ingestion, Databricks for processing, Delta Lake for data storage, and Power BI, Tableau, or Looker Studio for data visualization. This design provides scalability, flexibility, and efficient data management for analytics and reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory**: Data ingestion and pipeline orchestration
- **Azure Databricks**: Data processing using Apache Spark
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2**: Data storage for different stages (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- **Delta Lake**: Data format for efficient storage and processing
- **Power BI / Tableau / Looker Studio**: Optional tools for data visualization
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Optional advanced analytics platform

## Pipeline Overview

### Data Ingestion

- **Data Source**: E-Commerce data from [data.world](https://data.world/jfreex/e-commerce-users-of-a-french-c2c-fashion-store)
- **Ingestion Tool**: Azure Data Factory
- **Landing Zone-1**: Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2, where raw data is initially stored.

### Data Processing

- **Processing Engine**: Apache Spark on Azure Databricks
- **Layers**:
  - **Bronze**: Raw data in Parquet format from ADLS
  - **Silver**: Cleaned and transformed data
  - **Gold**: Final, curated dataset ready for reporting and analytics

### Data Storage

- **Storage Layer**: Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2
- **Data Format**: Delta Lake format for efficient processing and storage

### Data Visualization

- **Optional Tools**: Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio for creating dashboards and reports
- **Advanced Analytics**: Azure Synapse Analytics can be used for further analytics or warehousing

## Project Execution Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Azure Data Factory pipelines are used to copy data from `data.world` to a landing zone in ADLS Gen2.
   - Pipeline-1 is triggered when new data arrives in Landing Zone-1. It converts the raw data from CSV to Parquet format and stores it in Landing Zone-2.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - **Bronze Layer**: Raw data from ADLS is processed in Databricks using Apache Spark. Initial cleaning and transformations are applied.
   - **Silver Layer**: Further cleaning and transformations are done to prepare intermediate datasets.
   - **Gold Layer**: Final datasets are created by combining Silver data, performing necessary aggregations, and storing the processed data in Delta format.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Data is stored as Delta Lake tables in Azure Data Lake.
   - The final data (Gold Layer) is ready for visualization or further analytics.

4. **Data Serving and Visualization**:
   - Optionally, the processed data can be loaded into Power BI, Tableau, or Looker Studio for creating dashboards.
   - Azure Synapse Analytics can be integrated for advanced analytics and warehousing.
